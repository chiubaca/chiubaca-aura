## Why These Colors?

This theme captures:
- **Amber** — the warmth of a new dad writing poetry at 4am
- **Midnight blue** — the late nights, the depth, the "tinker until 2am" energy
- **Electric thread** — that curiosity that runs through everything you build

> "You give off 'approachable genius' energy. Not arrogant, not aloof. Just someone who's figured out that showing vulnerability isn't weakness."
